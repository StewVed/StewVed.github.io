Stewved's Github website!

After discovering that GitHub hosts websites for what looks like free, I am hoping to place my GitHub-Based Open Sourced webGames and webApps onto my GitHub website :D

The main page will grow as I create icon-based links (buttons) to my projects.

Eventually, I might even move my entire webtop onto here, though I would still make the production version compressed using Google Closure (or similar) simply to keep the download size down :D
